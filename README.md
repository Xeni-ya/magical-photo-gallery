# magical-photo-gallery

The challenge is to create a magical photo gallery of images of various magical items using CSS and position the images in a way that makes them look beautiful and attractive.

## What was done:

- HTML markup for the page that will host the gallery was created. Header, navigation menu, and container that will hold the images.

- Images of magic items were added and saved in the project folder.

- CSS was used to style the header, navigation menu, and container with images.

- Displayed the images in the container using positioning properties. The images are positioned so that they do not overlap each other and have equal indents between them.

- There is an effect when hovering over the images in the gallery.

- Testing the project on different devices and browsers to make sure it looks good and displays correctly.
